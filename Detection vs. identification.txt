We have to decide whether we want to work on detection or identification first.

Detection would include "Is there a <whatever> in this image?" and "Where is the <whatever> in this image?".

Identification is "Which <whatever> in this image?".

I recommend starting as simple and general as possible, though those are often competing interests.

In this case, for starters, we could go with "Is there a triangle in this image?".  I think that will handle the cases without requiring too much complexity and produce a resuable engine, though it will only output a boolean, not a location or identifier.
