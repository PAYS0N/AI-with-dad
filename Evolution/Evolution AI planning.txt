Nouns
	World
		This will be the code representation of the domain of the experiment.  It'll have things like a size - perhaps width and height, a list of participants in the world, the number of actions in a cycle and a cycle counter.  It might include something that represents the area where the participants can successfully reproduce - the participants' target zone.
	
	Lifespan
		A (potentially large) set of actions that participants take (like movements in a particular direction), after which the participants will be selected out (die) or selected in (reproduce).

	SimulationRun
		A (potentially large) set of Lifespans of activity, selection, and reproduction.

	"EvolutionParticipant"?  "GenomeCarrier"?  "Genotype"?
		We should have one root-level type (in coding, "class") that all of the evolution engine participants inherit from.  It would have some core capability verbs (in coding, "methods"), like "TakeATurn (in the world)", "Reproduce", or "Die".

		We may start with one type but want to add more types later, including different types and sub-types.
		
		For an example of a different types, we might want to experiment with symbiotic evolution later and add "Person" and "Pet" types, which may be very different, but .

		For an example of sub-types (in coding, "child classes"), we might want to experiment with sexual reproduction later, we might want "Male" and "Female" types that inherit from the Person type.

Verbs - we'll attach all the verbs to a specific object class

	Create a test
		Include number and types of participants.  Create them and randomize their genomes.  Place them in the world.
		Specify the survival location and the number of cycles to run.
	
	Run a test
		Go through the list of participants in the world and have each one do whatever it does for the cycle, based on its genome.
		Kill off the failures
			Based on the survival conditions, remove the non-survivors from the 
		Reproduce the successes

	Report on results
